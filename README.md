## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at using Tailwind CSS and it definitely makes handling CSS easier. I'm also quite shocked that I only needed to add very little custom CSS since almost everything was handled by the utility classes from Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) - This helped me with the concepts on ReactJS such as creating components and managing state and props.
- [Tailwind CSS Tutorial/Build a Discord-inspired Animated Navbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo) - This is a very short but very helpful tutorial on using Tailwind CSS.
- [Deploying Vite App to Github Pages](https://medium.com/@aishwaryaparab1/deploying-vite-deploying-vite-app-to-github-pages-166fff40ffd3) - This helped me with the steps on deploying the app using Github Pages.
